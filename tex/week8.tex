\begin{flashcard}[General terms]{Morula, Zona Pellucida, Trophoblast}
    The morula is a solid ball opposed to the blastula, which is hollowed. The morula is inside the zona pellucida until blastulation occurs. Trophoblast is the extraembryonic tissue in the blastula.

\begin{flashcard}[General terms]{When cells move through the primitive streak/node...}
    When cells move through the primitive streak in a mouse, they develop into mesoderm cells. Notochord if moving through node.
\end{flashcard}

\begin{flashcard}[General terms]{Totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, unipotent}
    Cells that can make respectively all cells (including extraembryonic), all cells (excluding extraembryonic), some types of cells, one type of cell.
\end{flashcard}


\begin{flashcard}[Experiment]{John B. Gurdon and Yamanaka showed that..}
    Normal cells can be induced to become pluripotent stem cells by subjecting them to specific transcription factors. Impossible with mechanical or chemical stress.
